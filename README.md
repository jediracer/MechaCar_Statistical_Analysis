## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance are: vehicle_length(intercept), ground_clearance and mpg.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero as the p-value(6.712e-11) is less than the significance level od 0.05%
- This liner model does predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively as the R-squared value(0.7119) is greater than .07.
